#With a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
#From your project directory, start up your application by running docker compose up.
docker compose up
#Compose pulls a Redis image, builds an image for your code, and starts the services you defined.
#In this case, the code is statically copied into the image at build time.
#Enter http://localhost:8000/ in a browser to see the application running.
#If this doesn't resolve, you can also try http://127.0.0.1:8000.
#You should see a message in your browser saying:
#Hello World! I have been seen 1 times.
#Refresh the page.

#The number should increment.
#Hello World! I have been seen 2 times.
#Switch to another terminal window, and type docker image ls to list local images.

#Listing images at this point should return redis and web.
 docker image ls
#You can inspect images with docker inspect <tag or id>.
#Stop the application, by:
docker compose down from within your project directory in the second terminal
#OR by hitting 
CTRL+C in the original terminal where you started the app.
