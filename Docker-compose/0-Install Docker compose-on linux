#To download and install Compose standalone on linux, run:
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.30.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
#Apply executable permissions to the standalone binary in the target path for the installation.
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
#Test and execute compose commands using docker-compose
docker-compose --help
#If the command docker-compose fails after installation, check your path. You can also create a symbolic link to /usr/bin or any other directory in your path. For example:
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
